Summary: If only I had the time...

## Breathe out, Breathe in
I really need to get around to typing up some notes I want to digitize from some recent events.  Particularly, beer making and homelab crap.  Time, truly the most precious commodity.    

Maybe this weekend!   

I just had to post something quick about a new band I found named Junius.  
I subscribe to [Decibel](https://www.decibelmagazine.com), which I recommend for anyone who has moved beyond the glory days that consisted
of massive amounts of free time and very little responsibility.  Those days are behind me now for sure, and Decibel is my go-to for keeping up with the metal scene 
other than a key friend who is still living his glory days.  

Decibel had a review for the new Junius album *Eternal Rituals for the Accretion of Light*.  I believe they gave it a 8 or 9 out of 10. The album is so damn good and 
it's basically been on repeat for me the last month or so.  Highly recommend you click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv_yKPChhq4) and check out the song *Mass for Metaphysicians*. 
The theme throughout the album regarding the path to transcendence only adds to the enjoyment of the music itself.  I think this will be one of my top 2017 albums for sure.

I took a stab at the lyrics to [*Black Sarcophagus*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpSsLb59B1o) below which ends the album (probably my favorite track) and speaks to the existentialism tone throughout the album.

The lyrical content makes me think of Fear Factory or Meshuggah's brand of constantly improving thyself.  Where as Fear Factory and Meshuggah go the route of a more cyborg-like reconstruction to the self in order to improve, Junius speaks more to spiriual transcendence by stepping beyond the physical realm.  

```
Seal the room
Light the fire
Burning clothes
The energy starts to flow

I am what I've learned
I meditate
My body shakes
The room starts to glow

Pouring over me
Higher frequencies
The final hour of the pain I'll devour

The bearer of light
The primal tones
Take my flesh and let me go

The final march
The seventh step
The death of this dream has come

All I have loved
All I have held
Has led to this sea of one

All I have loved
All I have held
Has led to this song of souls

Send me up now
Send me up now
Send me up now
I'm ready for time to die
I'm ready for infinite eyes
```
