I recently subscribed to [HackTheBox.eu](https://hackthebox.eu) and I've been enjoying it a lot.

I decided to fire back up the blog.. this time with jekyll as means of organizing 
my notes when doing writeups for the different boxes.  Pelican just didn't seem as supported anymore.
Also I don't have a ton of ruby experience so it'll help with that.

I really need to work on my whole setup of my laptop.  I'm using `vi` for this which is fine, but I 
just asked myself why the hell I'm not using vscode for markdown.

This time I'll probably write more on different metal too, just for keeping notes on great albums
and why i liked them in the first place.  Everyones got a blog, why not me too?

To be continued!
