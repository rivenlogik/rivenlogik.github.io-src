I came across what is potentially the best album of this year.

I'm talking about _Esoctrilihum - Eternity of Shaog._

I've heard many bands that are part of the "blacked death" genre.  This
album is closer to "deathened black"â„¢ (jk) metal.  Every track seems to be unique.

I can't stop listening to it.

I plan to do some hackthebox writeups in the near future with a plan to focus different
writeups on tools as I learn some of their useful commands etc.

Here's to hoping I stick with it this time.  Patience is a virtue.
