_We Left of Our Own Volition_ 

```console
Fili et filiae Hermetis!
Sons & Daughters of the Hidden Sun!

Brothers & Sisters of Hagios Gnofos
enjoined in nightly februation,
to reduce the distance between being and becoming,
to see through the looping mechanism embedded in the cycle of life.

Fili et filiae Hermetis!

We are the dead versus the Other,
same as we are the quick to the Other;
thence we are a part of this Other.

Alive enough to make manifest, Death-in-the-Self.
Sons & Daughters of the Hidden Sun!
If such a precept is firstly hard to grasp and ponder upon,
let alone integrate as a viable basis for contemplation...
then no wonder the illusion of distance between the you and the I
cannot be so readily shattered at the snap of a finger.

Brothers & Sisters of Hagios Gnofos!

The giving in to temptation,
the manifestation of this wanting need,
of independence, of rebellion,
is what truly created mankind.

The clay-born was not human prior to this transgression!
The Daimon who picked up the torch,
to lead man forward, and approve of this new form,
was none other than our Lord Lucifer.

Kindred of the Last Hour!
Neither mankind or the Light-Bearer were ever cast out!
Brethren we left of our own volition, and birthed ourselves anew.
And so, embrace the challenge! (Embrace the challenge!)
This divine enworldement-in-the-flesh!

For, in truth, it is thine sole legitimate sacrifice.
For, in truth, it is thine sole legitimate sacrifice.
For, in truth, it is thine sole legitimate sacrifice.
For, in truth, it is thine sole legitimate sacrifice.
For, in truth, it is thine sole legitimate sacrifice.
